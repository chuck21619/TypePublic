# Publishing

When a document is published from **Type** it is submitted to a platform or press as a finished piece of writing. Writers can publish directly to online outlets, self-hosted service, or retail distributers. The “magic” of publishing is the ability to preview the document according to format of the destination

### Publish vs export.

**Exporting** refers to rendering a document outside of **type** to another editable format, like PDF, TXT, DOC, or MD.

### Publish according to Layout.

**Publishing directly from Type without leaving the app is one of it's core features.** With Vendor Folders/Layouts, Writers will be able to preview how their work will look once it's published. Editing with a 1:1 preview is invaluable to a workflow, and a feature that isn't available anywhere outside of the platforms.

### Publish on a schedule, add it to your calendar.

you can schedule a document to publish at a certain time/date. Doing so also gives you the option of adding that to your calendar.

### Publishing To Platforms

Publishing to vendor platforms, directly from Type and know that how it looks to you is how it will look to everyone else.

* integrations with platforms like [medium](https://github.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/tree/4ef3f3ff3d823d4ffd76e78fd342e69cf220d977/docs/www.medium.com), [ghost](https://github.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/tree/4ef3f3ff3d823d4ffd76e78fd342e69cf220d977/docs/ghost.org), or [SmallVictories](https://github.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/tree/4ef3f3ff3d823d4ffd76e78fd342e69cf220d977/docs/smallvictori.es)

### Email Marketing

A sleeper feature would be to generate newsletters from within Type, Email marketing is a big business and both allowing users to generate their own campaigns or integrate with their company of choice [mailchimp](https://github.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/tree/4ef3f3ff3d823d4ffd76e78fd342e69cf220d977/docs/www.mailchimp.com), [tinyletter](https://github.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/tree/4ef3f3ff3d823d4ffd76e78fd342e69cf220d977/docs/tinyletter.com) would be worth developing.

It would be a matter of establishing a layout for them

### Nice looking Code Fences for Documents

Text wrapped in the code tag \`\`\` will be wrapped in a code fence. The writer can declare the syntax by clicking the syntax button at the top right of the fence and the code inside will highlight accordingly. Code fences can have their own line numbers.

## Publishing Sideboard

This sideboard pops-out whenever the writer wishes to publish. \(submit to a platform\) or export \(create a copy outside of Type in a particular format\)

## Auto-Generate

When publishing, writers have the option of generating additional reference pages based on associated parts of the document\(s\) or Folder.

1. Table of Contents - Based on Outline of a document, or document names of a folder.
2. End Notes, Bibliography - based on Bibliography for a document or folder
3. Glossary - based on a glossary note attached to document
