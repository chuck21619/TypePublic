Notes are similar to documents with the exception that they can be displayed & edited in the [**Notes Sideboard**](https://github.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/wiki/Sideboard#Notes) and [**Desktop Assistant**](https://github.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/wiki/Assistant#Desktop-Assistant) as well as the standard workspace.

### Auxillary Components
Notes are responsible for generating the additional components of a document. For example, the table of contents, glossary, index, and _sidebar can all be edited as a note.

`[Defined Word](This is the definition of the word)`

_Maybe the note needs to be named "!Glossary or have some kind of special naming convention to indicate it's functionality. The Sidebar for Git Wikis is `_sidebar`_
