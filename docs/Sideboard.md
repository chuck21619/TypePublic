The sideboard is a panel that reveals itself from the right of the workspace. It displays information and settings related to the selected document/folder in the workspace as well the app itself.

**Every sideboard has a keyboard shortcut associated with it.**

_The idea_ behind the sideboard is that you can see important information or tinker with settings while maintaining an unobstructed view of the writing.

#### Info
Displays relative information and data for a selected document (or documents if a folder is selected).

**Author**
**Last Edit Date**
**Creation Date**
_**(optional) Publish Date**_
**Tags**
**Targets**
Add/Remove goals associated with the document. Targets added to folders are set against every document in the folder/subfolder.
examples:
* "At least (_n_) Words|Characters|Pages"
* "At most (_n_) Words|Characters|Pages"

**Composition**


#### Notes
Much like having a notepad next to your keyboard. Notes is A space to add text that you want associated with the document for reference purposes.

#### Outline
Some writers might want to have the outline outside of the workspace, so it can be displayed in the sideboard.

#### Bibliography/Works Cited
Writers can add annotated citation in the Bibliography sideboard, and reference their sources in the document. The inverse also works, writers can cite text in the workspace without a reference in the sideboard. This will add a placeholder reference which they can fill in later.

**Options**
1. MLA,APA, Chicago
2. Running Head

**Annotated**
1. Author (last name, first name).
2. Title of source.
3. Title of the container,
4. Other contributors (names and roles),
5. Version,
6. Number,
7. Publisher,
8. Publication Date,
9. Location of the source (such as URL or page range).
10. Summary or Analysis.

>References in the Sideboard can be reordered. Doing so will update the citation in the document. See [Reference Reordering](https://github.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/wiki/Mechanics#Reordering)

#### Publish & Export
This sideboard appears when the writer is ready to publish or export their work. The options differe depending on the layout selected

**options from the sideboard**
1. Add or change the layout

#### Settings & Accounts
Settings for the entire app can be accessed from the settings Sideboard. It is opened with the standard **⌘,** shortcut native to all macOS apps.

**Accounts**
With the Settings Sideboard focused, hitting **tab** will toggle the Accounts sideboard. Here one can manage the account information regarding the integrations between Type and another platform (like Medium, Dropbox, etc).

#### Updates
When Type pushes updates to writers they can read the release notes in the sidebar and update right there. They also have the option of reverting to the previous release candidate.

Additionally, it'd be interesting to provide optional "example" files or documents that demonstrate a new feature. i.e. if there is a new Layout, it can be downloaded to the folio and edited.

#### Shortcuts

#### Dictionary & Thesaurus
Integrate the macOS dictionary app to display word definitions and synonyms. Defition requests are called via the **Assistant** or by typing in the search bar at the top of the sideboard.

>Should there be a way to quickly add a word from the list of resuts to the document? i.e. if the results were numbered, and entering a number would interject the word?
