# Folio

The folio is the left-hand panel where documents are created and organized. Files are stored locally in the user's **Documents** folder by default, with options to change and add folder location\(s\).

#### File Management

Documents in the Folio can be grouped into [**folders**](https://github.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/wiki/Folders), **merged** together and [**tagged**](https://github.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/wiki/tags).

**Merging**

Documents can be merged together by selecting them in the folio and choosing "merge" from either the context menu \(right click\) or toolbar \(edit &gt; merge\). Alternatively, one can use the shortcut: **⌘E**

**When documents are merged, the writer has the option of renaming the new document created by the merge.** when documents are merged with different layouts applied, the [**Layout**](https://github.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/wiki/Layouts) of the _First_ or _Top-most_ document designates the Layout for the new merged documents.

**Deleting**

Files & Folders which are deleted from the Folio go to the **MacOS trash**.

#### Presentation

![Examples](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/master/Img/folio_presentation.png)

Documents & Folders in the Folio can be displayed in three different ways:

* **Outlined** list
* **Detailed** list
* **Thumbnails**.

## RELATIVE DATES: "Yesterday, etc"

**Outlined List** is the default folio presentation. It is the most compact view of files with the names of the folders and documents displayed with their corresponding icon. If a document is tagged, it will appear as a dot after the document name. Documents with unsaved changes will display their document name in italic and with a dot to the left. Folders can expand and collapse their contents by clicking on the disclosure triangle `▶`.

 **Detailed List** The detailed list is shown when a folder is in [**focus**](https://github.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/wiki/Folders#Folder-focus). Here, the font weight increases and the item displays the **edit date**, **position number**, and **tag name**.

Subfolders are represented simply with their name centered in the folio.

_When in focus, the list can change by zooming on the folio, or changing it in the menu_

**Thumbnails** When the **Presentation** or **Book** layouts are applied to a folder, the writer has the option of displaying documents as thumbnails. Thumbnails can be displayed in a single column or in a 2x1 column \(known as **Verso/Recto**\) for book writing.

**Pages** divides the document into 8.5x11 page thumbnails.

* sections indicate a new document

#### Security

**Password Protecting** writers should have the option of locking any writing they have behind a password. Locking a folder will lock access to every item in that folder.

![Examples](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/master/Img/folio_passwor-d.png)

**Options:** 1. auto-lock on a timer 2. auto-lock on sleep 3. 1Password integration/Apple Keychain

**Emergency key, that unlocks any document if you forget the one you set**

### The Archive

The archive is a companion collection of documents within the folio that have either been [**Published**](https://github.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/wiki/Publish) or moved there by the writer.

![Examples](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/master/Img/folio_archive.png)

Documents in the Archive have an "archive date" displayed in the file's [**Info Sideboard**](https://github.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/wiki/Info). These files can be retrieved/copied from the archive and re-enter the Folio manually.
