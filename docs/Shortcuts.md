### Markdown & Formatting
**Note:** It doesnt matter if there is a space between the # and the next character. if a `#` starts a line, that line is a headline.you dont need to add a space between the `#` and the following word to make it a headline/title/or subtitle. Once a `#` is inserted at the **beginning** of a line that entire line is marked as a headline/title/subtitle until the user hits **return (↩)** or **Right Shift (⇧)**

Standard MacOS shortcuts apply (i.e. **⌘+A** is select all)

### Writing Mechanics
**NOTE:** Cursor proximity and highlighting: if the cursor is touching a word it is a candidate for formatting shortcuts/manipulation. It does not need to be fully highlighted.
