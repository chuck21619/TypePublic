# Assistant

The Assistant is a workflow aid which aims to reduce multi-step and repetitive tasks down to written requests. It can complete operations inside the workspace, or globally within the app \(like changing an app setting\)

## In the Workspace...

When called, The Assistant appears as an input field in the workspace and pushes the viewport _down_ from the top, _up and down_ at the cursor cursor, or _up_ from the bottom of the workspace.

**The assistant is the tool for Find, and Find & Replace.** Using the standard shortcuts for find \(**⌘F**\) and find & Replace \(**⇧⌘F**\) call the Assistant. Alternatively the assistant can be called and the writer could type, "Find" then add a word and it would work the same. The benefit with using the assistant is the ability to add natural language specifics with terms like, "Every", "Every Other", "The first \(_n_\)."

Another example of natural language commands would be: **"Bold every H1."** which would bold the text connected to each Headline 1. Alternatively, the same thing would occur if you requested: "**Bold all \#.**"

**Results in the Assistant are context aware.** highlighted text will alter how the results appear depending on what the cursor is touching or the syntax selected.

For example: If text was highlighted, The results would look like this:

| Assistant Entry: "De" |
| :--- |
| Fuzzy Results: |
| "**De**lete _selected text_" |
| "**De**-select _text_" |
| "**De**-fine _selected word_" |

If the cursor was inside of a list, or a list was selected the results would look like this:

| Assistant Entry: "Change" |
| :--- |
| Fuzzy Results: |
| "**Change** _**List**_ _Type_" |
| "**Change** _**List**_ _order_" |

## Desktop Assistant

The Assistant can be opened from outside the application to edit/add notes from the Folio. When called, the window works similar to notational velocity where the initial keystrokes perform a fuzzy search of all notes, and if no note contains what you've typed, then you can create a new note from whatever it is you entered.

being able to quickly capture them I think is invaluable.\*\*

> Notes are saved in a special "notebook" folder

## Assistant command structure

The loose sequence for assistant commands is, "Verb + _Adjective_ + Noun". In some cases it will be "Verb + Noun + _Adverb_."

> In most cases, The **noun** will probably be the bolded result of a fuzzy search, as writers will probably know _what_ they want before they know what they can do.
