# Tags

Tags work exactly as they do in MacOS. They are assigned to **documents** and allow for categorization and filtering of items in the Folio.

> Folders cannot be tagged, but can represent the tags of the documents it contains.

## Tag appearance

In the outline list, tags appear as colored dots on the right of the document name. However, when the document becomes **focused** the tag will appear as a pill with the name presented inside of it

### Adding/Removing Tags:

* Right-clicking a document and adding a tag through the context menu
* Selecting add tag from the Menu bar \(File &gt; New Tag\)
* Adding a new tag from the Info Sideboard with the document selected
* Via Assistant command.
