> **Note:** In split view, The outline is only displayed in the active document containing the cursor.

### Split Preview

Split view and preview can be combined to show markdown on one side, and the layout preview on the other. The windows can scroll in sync with one another, and the preview updates in real time.

## Whiteboard

The whiteboard offers a thumbnail view of documents in the workspace.

Whenever a **single folder** is selected in the folio, the documents contained are displayed in the workspace as a gallery of thumbnails. These thumbnails can be rearranged, merged, deleted, and opened and the changes are reflected in the folio.
