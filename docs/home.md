Type is a modern markdown editor built around the mechanics of typing. The goal of the application is to create an efficent environment which promotes better writing through design. **Type** was developed with the idea that, "Applications for creativity should encourage output through subtlety.” Every part of Type, the structure, syntax, and mechanics, operate in concert to achieve that.

## Structure

The components of the application window, from left to right, are established to parallel the writing process from draft to publication. A document is born on the left, edited in the center, and published from the right side of the window.

**The stucture of type delibrately keeps the writing front and center.** Every feature is in service of the writing.
