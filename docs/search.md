# Search

Search is contextual to the location of the search input. For instance, if a writer uses the search field in the folio, they are searching through the documents and folders in the folio, likewise for the workspace and sidebar.

**Basic search accepts markdown syntax as a filter.** If you search "\#Something" it will return all documents with H1's titled "Something"

## Advanced

Filter from a checklist of attributes 1. Tags 2. Text 3. Reference 4. Has images 5. Attached Images/media

#### Tags / Keywords

Tags in Type act the same as tags in MacOS. They act as "Keyword" filters which can be searched. Tags can be assigned to **documents only**. Tags will appear on collapsed Folders if said folder contains documents with tags.

#### Assistant Search

1. Returns results for only the selected document

#### Filters

Filters are saved search queries/criteria, represented by an icon in the folio. They operate the same way **Smart Folders** do in MacOS. When creating a filter, you see the results real time in the folio.

#### Examples of Filters

1. Documents with \(Layout\) Assigned to them.
2. Documents with word count of X
3. Documents created within the past month/week/day
4. Documents with Notes/images

### Find Next Instance/Find Inline

Also lifted from text editors: Find the next instance of selected text or word the cursor touches. \(**⌘D**\). This also creates multiple cursors.
