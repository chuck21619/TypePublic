A Layout is a set of defined styles which are applied to the markdown of a document once it has been **published/exported**. The layout for a document/folder can be changed at any time, and does not effect how the markdown appears in the workspace while writing.

Seldom are writers also typographers or designers. The power of Layouts leverages markdown to allow same plain text to look completely different just by changing one setting.

#### Applying a layout
 Layouts are assigned to documents and folders from the Info [**Sideboard**](https://github.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/wiki/Sideboard),via [**Assistant**](https://github.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/wiki/Assistant)Command, or from the Menu bar/Contextual [**Menus**](https://github.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/wiki/Menus).**Layouts can be assigned at the point of publishing/export.**

> Assigning a layout to a folder overrides the individual document layouts contained in the folder. The top level folder sets the layout. It also changes the icon of the folder

### Complimentary Components
Certain layouts offer additional features.

1. **Book** gets the option for a Table of Contents, Glossary which are supported with [note](https://github.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/wiki/Notes)
**books have a table of contents that can be generated by the outline, or a Gloassary that can be created from a [note](https://github.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/wiki/Notes).**

2. A vendor layout like [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/) would have a daily target of 10,000 words a day built in to it's Info, since that's the whole idea for the event.

### Previewing a layout
Writers can see how their work looks when a layout is applied by the **[Previewing](https://github.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/wiki/Views#preview)** the document.
