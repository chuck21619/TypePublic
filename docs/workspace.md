# Workspace

The workspace is where all of the writing occurs. It is structured with a **text column** in the center, a left, right, top, and bottom margins.

## Text Column Dimensions

The width of the text column is defined by the amount of characters that will fit on a single line. Writers have the option of a standard \(**72 char.**\) or wide \(**96 char.**\) text column

1. Paragraph Spacing
2. First Line indent
3. Line Height \(locked\)

> The text column will increase/decrease slightly depending on the font size _**Font Size** x **0.5** = **line height**_

## The Beginning starts in the middle

Every document starts around the middle of the viewport. This is just good visual ergonomics. the more text that is entered will push the first lines of text up toward the top of the workspace.

## Lines vs Rows

A line is a series of text unbroken by a **Return.** Because of this, a single _line_ can be as multiple _rows_ of text in the workspace. Lines in type are numbered, rows are not.

## Font Size "Zoom"

Font size is adjusted by Zooming in\(**⌘+**\) and out \(**⌘-**\) of the workspace. The line heights adjust proportionately to text size:

## Typewriter Scrolling

Typewriter scrolling is an option which fixes the text scroll to either the top, middle ,or bottom of the viewport. Text scrolls up or down relative to the chosen position.

_Note: Top and Bottom are not the absolute top and absolute bottom. Its more like Top = 30% from the top and bottom is 30% from the bottom._

## Smooth Scrolling Animation

The viewport has a slight smoothing animation when jumping around a document.

**Arrowing up at the top of a document, or Down at the bottom will scroll to the Previous or Next Document.** While editing a document in the Workspace, if the cursor is at the end or beginning of a document, hitting the up arrow will move to the document before, or after the current one.
