# Folders

Folders are considered **groups** of documents, notes, and other folders in the folio. Folders are created either “grouping” selected documents \(**⌘G**\) or making a new folder from scratch \(**⌘⇧N**\).

**Folders can be removed from the folio by dissolving \(**_**ungrouped**_**\) or deleting.** Selecting a folder and “Ungrouping” or dissolving it \(**⌘⇧G**\), will free the contents and remove the folder. This is a non-destructive way of file management. Alternatively, if a folder is **deleted**, it and all of it's contents are sent ot the trashcan.

## Folder Focus

Focusing on a folder comes from the same idea as "Switching Projects" in other text editors. When a folder is in focus, only it's contents are displayed in the folio.

**To focus on a folder click the arrow that appears when its selected, or with the shortcut ⌘+Return** Hitting **escape** or the back arrow will return the writer to all the files of folio.

## Layout Folders

Folders can have a [**Layout**](https://github.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/wiki/Layouts) assigned to them which applies the same layout to every file it contains. \(overriding any layouts previously assigned to individual docs/folders\).

**External folders and folders with a layout have unique icons. Documents contained within these folders can also have unique icons**

## Order

**Documents in the folio follow an ascending order. The document on top is considered first, and the bottom document is last.** The order of documents in the folio determines the order text will appear when documents are exported/published. The order of files is easily [**rearranged**](https://github.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/wiki/Rearranging) up or down the folio by clicking and dragging or via keyboard shortcuts.

## Open folders fix to the top.

When a folder is opened and contains documents/subfolders, the position of the folder will stick to the top of the folio and everything will scroll beneath it, until the next open folder pushed the previous one out of view.

Closed folders will not become fixed to the top.
