# Documents

Documents are the plain-text markdown \(**.md**\) files. These files store additional meta/compositional data that can be viewed in the app. Additionally, documents can be styled by applying a [**Layout**](https://github.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/wiki/Layouts).

Documents in **Type** collect and display data regarding the documents composition as well as any attributes assigned by the writer. All data associated with a document is viewed in the [**info sideboard**](https://github.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/wiki/sideboard#info)

Change the name of a document:

1. With the shortcut **âŒ˜R** \(this also works for Folders\)
2. Change the name within the [**Info**](https://github.com/JEFLBROWN/Type/wiki/info) Sideboard
3. Click the name in the titlebar at the top of the window.
