## Monochromatic Option

For writers who want a traditional look, dark-grey text on off-white, or grey text on dark grey.

## Low-Light Option

Good for low light environments with Low Screen backlighting where you don't want to disturb anyone else. \(like a plane or in bed\)

## High-Light Option

For really bright conditions, like being outside on a sunny day.

## Color Blind Options

Create accessible themes for the color blind \(no one does this & everyone will steal it\). These would be based on a contrast palette for the different variations of color blindness.

**Protanomaly** Red/Green **Protanopia** Red/Green **Deuteranomaly** Red/Green **Deuteranopia** Red/Green **Tritanomaly** Blue/Yellow **Tritanopia** Blue/Yellow **Achromatopsia** Totally Color blind
