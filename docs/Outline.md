The outline is a list of links to every H1, H2 and, H3 in the document. It is positioned **either** in the left margin of the Workspace or in the **Sideboard**. In both instances the outline is centered horizontally.

By default, it does not extend to the very top or bottom of the workspace, as it has a top and bottom margin to help with readability. Additionally, to save space, nested items in the outline can be collapsed by their parent tag.

### Features of the outline:
The outline serves as a quick reference to the structure of the document and allows the writer to jump around the document, by clicking on the links, or rearrange text by dragging the entries up or down the outline.

Some additional features of the outline include:
- Builds in real time as you write (with subtle animations for new additions)
- **Bolds** the link of the section that contains the cursor.
- Inc/Dec font size of the outline with ⌘+ and ⌘-
- Show/Hide Outline
- Image icon where images occupy a line.

### Rules of Arrangement
Headline tags ( **#**, **##**, **###** )  act in a nested hierarchy with H1 being at the top, followed by H2, and then H3. Headlines in a document will group all the text that follows until the next occurance of a headline tag higher on the hierarchy. For example...

#### **Example Outline**
```
# Headline A
  ## Headline B
    ### Headline C
    ### Headline D
  ## Headline E
# Headline F
    ### Headline G
```
Here is an example of an outline structure. It has two H1's (Headline A and F) two H2s (headline B and E), and three H3's (Headline C,D, and G).

#### **Result One:**
```
# Headline F
    ### Headline G
# Headline A
  ## Headline B
    ### Headline C
    ### Headline D
  ## Headline E
```
In result one, Headline *F* has been moved **above** headline ***A*** from the example. This results in the nested Headline *G* to move along with it.

#### **Result Two:**
```
# Headline A
  ## Headline E
  ## Headline B
    ### Headline C
    ### Headline D
# Headline F
    ### Headline G
```
In result two, Headline ***B*** has been moved below Headline ***E*** from the example outline. The result is the nested Headlines ***C*** and ***D*** moving along with Headline ***E*** in the same nested position.
